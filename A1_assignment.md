3. **Purpose:** Clearly articulate the significance of your research and its broader implications, answering the question of why it matters.

## 2. How to Read a Paper
### How to read a paper
This article introduces a practical and efficient three-pass method for reading research papers, aiming to enhance comprehension and save time.
### THE THREE-PASS APPROACH

**First Pass: Quick Overview**

Spend about 5–10 minutes to grasp the paper's general idea:

1. Read the title, abstract, and introduction carefully.

2. Review section and sub-section headings without diving into details.

3. Read the conclusions.

4. Glance over the references, noting familiar works.

After this pass, you should be able to answer:

- **Category:** What type of paper is it (e.g., measurement study, analysis, prototype description)?

- **Context:** Which other papers or theories is it related to?

- **Correctness:** Are the assumptions valid?

- **Contributions:** What are the main contributions?

- **Clarity:** Is the paper well-written?

This pass helps decide whether a deeper reading is worthwhile.

**Second Pass: Grasp Content Without Details**

Take up to an hour to understand the paper's content more thoroughly:

1. Examine figures, diagrams, and illustrations carefully.

2. Ignore detailed proofs but understand the main arguments.

3. Note down key points and make comments in the margins.

By the end of this pass, you should be able to summarize the paper's main ideas and contributions.

**Third Pass: In-Depth Understanding**

For papers crucial to your research:

1. Identify and challenge the paper's assumptions.

2. Thoroughly understand the methodologies and proofs.

3. Consider how you would present the work, highlighting strengths and weaknesses.

This comprehensive approach ensures a deep understanding of the paper's content and context.

**Applying the Method to Literature Surveys**

When conducting a literature survey:

1. Use the first pass to identify relevant papers.

2. Apply the second pass to select a subset for detailed understanding.

3. Use the third pass on the most pertinent papers to your research.

This structured method allows for efficient and effective assimilation of research papers. 

## 3. How to write a report
The article provides an overview of common assessment types students may encounter:

**Essays:**
Structured pieces of writing on specific subjects, typically including:
- **Introduction:** Outlines the topic and approach.
- **Body:** Presents main points with supporting evidence.
- **Conclusion:** Summarizes key points and restates the topic.

**Presentations:**
Involves presenting key ideas, possibly through posters or slides, and should include:
- **Introduction:** Introduces the topic and outlines coverage.
- **Body:** Explains main points.
- **Conclusion:** Summarizes main points.

Information can be presented using bullet points, quotes, pictures, charts, or diagrams.

**Quizzes:**
May consist of various question types, such as multiple choice, short answer, fill-in-the-blanks, extended response, or essay style.

**Other Assessment Types:**
- **Annotated Bibliography:** A list of resources with brief summaries and evaluations.
- **Case Study:** Describes real situations over time, providing detailed information about a person, group, or situation, often requiring analysis or problem-solving.

Understanding these assessment types can help students prepare effectively and meet course learning outcomes.
