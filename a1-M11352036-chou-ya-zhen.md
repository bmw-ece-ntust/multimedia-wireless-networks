## I.I Tips for a Memorable 5 Minute Research Presentation
> “If you get the first 5 minutes down, you are going to be golden for the rest of your presentation.” 

There are three parts of a presentation that can influence the outcome of the presentation.

- You, the speaker
- Your presentation slides
- The audience

Here is what makes your 5-minute pitch memorable:

- It is passionate: This comes with understanding what inspires your work. Passion for research leads you to excel, even when you suffer setbacks.
- It tells a good story: when you have a flow with compelling images, it helps tell a story, saves explanation, and hooks the audience.
- It gives a ‘why’: from your presentation, the audience should know why they should care about your work, the implications of your results and how they can apply this information.

## I.II Mastering 5 Minute Presentations
Tips for a Powerful 5-Minute Presentation

### 1. Focus on One Key Concept
- Even with a short timeframe, conduct thorough research beforehand.
- Start by getting straight to the point—use a story or compelling example to introduce your main idea.
- Avoid overloading your audience with statistics; ensure any numbers you use connect with your narrative.

### 2. Keep Slides Simple and Clean
- Use a single font style and limit text—only include key points.
- Stick to 2-3 colors in a clean, professional template.
- Incorporate striking visuals that enhance understanding and maintain audience engagement.
- Organize data clearly, ensuring any charts or graphs emphasize the main message.

### 3. Practice Until Perfect
- Rehearse multiple times, refining your delivery with each run-through.
- Practice in front of a mirror or record yourself to assess tone, inflections, and body language.
- Avoid reading directly from your slides—engage with the audience confidently.
- Repetition will help make your presentation polished and memorable.

By following these principles, you can deliver an effective and engaging five-minute presentation that leaves a lasting impact.

## II. How to read a paper
### The Three-Pass Method
A structured approach to reading papers in three stages, each with increasing depth.

**Key Takeaways**
- **Efficiency**: Prioritize depth for valuable papers only.
- **Critical Thinking**: Question assumptions and contributions at each pass.
- **Flexibility**: Tailor the method to your role (e.g., reader, reviewer).

### 1. First Pass: Quick Overview (5-10 minutes)

**Goal**: Get a bird’s-eye view and decide if the paper merits further reading.
**Steps**:
1. Read the title, abstract, and introduction carefully.
2. Scan section and subsection headings for structure.
3. Check the conclusions for key takeaways.
4. Skim the references, noting familiar works.

**Key Questions**:
- Category: What type of paper is it (e.g., experimental, survey)?
- Context: How does it relate to other work?
- Correctness: Are assumptions reasonable?
- Contributions: What are the main claims?
- Clarity: Is it well-written?

**Outcome**:
- Stop if irrelevant.
- Proceed if promising.
- Set aside for background (e.g., surveys).
  
Tip: Filters out 50-80% of papers for experienced readers.

### 2. Second Pass: Grasp Content (1 hour)

**Goal**: Understand the paper’s content without diving into proofs or fine details.
**Steps**:
1. Study figures, diagrams, and illustrations closely (e.g., trends, labels).
2. Read the main text, skipping complex proofs or equations.
3. Mark references for later exploration.

**Key Actions**:
- Summarize key points in your own words.
- Note contributions and evidence.
- Spot strengths and weaknesses.

**Outcome**:
- Explain the paper’s gist to someone else.
- Decide if a third pass is needed.

**Example**: Focus on a performance graph, not algorithm details.
### 3. Third Pass: Deep Understanding (4-5 hours for beginners, ~1 hour for experts)

**Goal**: Fully grasp the paper, as if recreating it.
**Steps**:
1. Read every section critically:
  - Assumptions: Are they valid?
  - Methods: Could they be better?
  - Evidence: Does it support claims?
2. Reconstruct the argument:
  - Identify problem, approach, solution.
  - Challenge claims and spot gaps.
3. Take detailed notes:
  - Record insights, critiques, and ideas for future work.

**Outcome**:
- Match the author’s understanding.
- Prepare for review, implementation, or extension.
Tip: Compare to your knowledge—what’s novel?

## III. How to Write a Report
### Notes on Assignment Types

Depending on your course of study, you may encounter various types of assignments designed to meet specific learning outcomes. Here's an overview of the most common assignment types:

### Essays

An essay is a piece of writing on a specific subject, topic, or issue. Essays typically include:

- **Introduction**: States what you will discuss, how you will discuss it, and what you aim to demonstrate.
- **Body**: Introduces main points, explains them, and provides supporting evidence, showing how each point relates to your overall argument.
- **Conclusion**: Restates the topic discussed (similar to the introduction, but rephrased) and summarizes your main points, clarifying the context of your argument.

You may need to understand what has happened and why, or analyze the situation to solve a problem.

### Reflective Writing

Reflective writing involves thinking and writing about your learning experiences. The aim is to help you focus on the insights you may have gained—for example, during a practicum.

### Reviews/Literature Reviews or Summaries

A review focuses on the purpose of something and whether that purpose has been achieved. Reviews summarize and synthesize arguments and ideas but do not introduce new ideas.

### Reports

Reports are structured documents that present information, analysis, and recommendations on a specific topic or issue. They often include:

- **Title Page**: Includes the report title, your name, and the date.
- **Abstract or Executive Summary**: Provides a brief overview of the report's content.
- **Table of Contents**: Lists sections and page numbers.
- **Introduction**: Outlines the report's purpose and scope.
- **Methodology**: Describes how information was gathered.
- **Findings/Results**: Presents the information or data collected.
- **Discussion**: Analyzes and interprets the findings.
- **Conclusion**: Summarizes the report and may include recommendations.
- **References**: Lists sources used.
- **Appendices**: Contains supplementary material.

### Case Studies

Case studies involve an in-depth analysis of a particular case, situation, or individual to illustrate broader principles or findings. They typically require:

- **Description of the Case**: Provides background information.
- **Identification of Key Issues**: Highlights the main problems or challenges.
- **Analysis**: Examines the issues using relevant theories or concepts.
- **Solutions/Recommendations**: Suggests possible solutions or actions.

### Presentations

Presentations involve delivering information to an audience verbally, often supplemented with visual aids like slides. Effective presentations typically include:

- **Clear Structure**: Introduction, body, and conclusion.
- **Engaging Content**: Relevant information presented in an interesting manner.
- **Visual Aids**: Slides, charts, or videos to support the spoken content.
- **Delivery Skills**: Clear speech, eye contact, and appropriate pacing.

Understanding the specific requirements and expectations of each assignment type is crucial for academic success. Always refer to your course materials and guidelines to ensure you meet the necessary criteria.
