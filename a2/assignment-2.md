    ## Milestone 2: Full-Queue Model Transmission & Mobility Model

**Full-Queue Model Transmission:**

* Each STA continuously transmits UDP packets at 1 Mbps (DataRate = "1Mbps", PacketSize = 1400).
* `UdpClientHelper` is configured with `MaxPackets = 0` (unlimited) and a calculated `Interval` to ensure continuous sending, approximating a full-queue scenario.
* **Note:** Each STA sends traffic simultaneously towards both AP A and AP B.
    * Source Code Link: Installing Clients to Both APs

**Mobility Model & Simulation Duration:**

* Simulation Duration: 180 seconds.
    * Source Code Link: Simulation Time Variable
    * Source Code Link: Simulator Stop Time
* Mobility: STAs use `ConstantPositionMobilityModel` but their positions are updated instantly at scheduled times using `SetPosition`. Re-association is facilitated by the STA WiFi MAC layer (`ActiveProbing = true`).
    * Source Code Link: STA MAC Active Probing
    * Source Code Link: Mobility Update Function Call
    * Source Code Link: Setting Position in Mobility Function

**User Movement Schedule:**

* At t = 60 seconds: (moveTime1)
    * Percentages: 25% A â†’ B (percentAtoB_M1), 50% B â†’ A (percentBtoA_M1).
    * Number Moving A â†’ B: 16 \* 0.25 = 4 users.
    * Number Moving B â†’ A: 16 \* 0.50 = 8 users.
    * Specific Users Moved:
        * A â†’ B (Near AP B): STAs 0, 1, 2, 3. (Code Link: Move Schedule 1)
        * B â†’ A (Near AP A): STAs 16, 17, ..., 23. (Code Link: Move Schedule 1)
    * Physical Distribution after 60s: X1 = 20 near A, Y1 = 12 near B.
* At t = 120 seconds: (moveTime2)
    * Percentages: 50% A â†’ B (percentAtoB_M2), 50% B â†’ A (percentBtoA_M2). Applied to current populations (20 near A, 12 near B).
    * Number Moving A â†’ B: 20 \* 0.50 = 10 users.
    * Number Moving B â†’ A: 12 \* 0.50 = 6 users.
    * Specific Users Moved:
        * A â†’ B (Near AP B): STAs 4, 5, ..., 13. (Code Link: Move Schedule 2, uses offsets)
        * B â†’ A (Near AP A): STAs 24, 25, ..., 29. (Code Link: Move Schedule 2, uses offsets)

## ðŸ“Š 3. Analysis Report

**1. Final User Distribution**

* The simulation models the physical movement of STAs between the vicinities of AP A and AP B.

* Initial State (t=0s):
    * Users physically near AP A (X0): 16 (IDs 0-15)
    * Users physically near AP B (Y0): 16 (IDs 16-31)

* State after 1st Movement (t=60s):
    * 4 users (IDs 0-3) move from A â†’ B.
    * 8 users (IDs 16-23) move from B â†’ A.
    * Users physically near AP A (X1): (16 - 4) + 8 = 20
    * Users physically near AP B (Y1): (16 - 8) + 4 = 12
    * Conceptual User Table (Physical Location):
        * Near A: {4..15} âˆª {16..23}
        * Near B: {0..3} âˆª {24..31}

* State after 2nd Movement (t=120s):
    * 10 users (IDs 4-13) move from A â†’ B.
    * 6 users (IDs 24-29) move from B â†’ A.
    * Users physically near AP A (X2): (20 - 10) + 6 = 16
    * Users physically near AP B (Y2): (12 - 6) + 10 = 16
    * Conceptual User Table (Physical Location):
        * Near A: {14, 15} âˆª {16..23} âˆª {24..29}
        * Near B: {0..3} âˆª {30, 31} âˆª {4..13}

* Final Calculated User Distribution (at t=180s):
    * Value of X (Users physically near AP A): 16
    * Value of Y (Users physically near AP B): 16
    * (Note: Only the initial user table is printed by the code; subsequent distributions are derived from the simulation logic.)

**2. Aggregated Throughput Analysis**

* The aggregated throughput (rate of data successfully received) at each AP's sink application was logged every second into `aggregated_throughput.txt` (see Appendix C).
* The plot below was generated using `graph.py` (see Appendix B).

* Throughput Plot:

    ![Throughput Plot](src/Figure_1.png)
    * Analysis of Throughput Trends:

    * Initial Phase (t=4s to ~60s): After clients start at t=3s, throughput ramps up. Both AP A and AP B achieve a stable throughput of approximately 16 Mbps each. This balanced throughput matches the initial balanced user distribution (16 STAs near each AP). The total system throughput (~32 Mbps) corresponds to the total number of STAs (32) multiplied by their individual transmission rate (1 Mbps).
    * First Movement Impact (t â‰ˆ 60s): At t=60s, the physical distribution changes to 20 STAs near A and 12 near B. The plot shows an immediate corresponding shift in throughput:
        * AP A's throughput jumps to approximately 20 Mbps.
        * AP B's throughput drops to approximately 12 Mbps.
        * This indicates that STAs quickly re-associate with their nearest AP after moving, and the network load redistributes accordingly.
    * Intermediate Phase (t=~61s to ~120s): Throughput remains stable at the new levels (~20 Mbps for A, ~12 Mbps for B), reflecting the unbalanced user distribution during this period.
    * Second Movement Impact (t â‰ˆ 120s): At t=120s, the physical distribution returns to 16 STAs near A and 16 near B. The plot shows the throughput adjusting back:
        * AP A's throughput decreases to approximately 16 Mbps.
        * AP B's throughput increases to approximately 16 Mbps.
        * This further confirms that the aggregated throughput at each AP closely follows the number of users associated with it.
    * Final Phase (t=~121s to 180s): The system returns to a balanced state, with both APs sustaining approximately 16 Mbps each, similar to the initial phase.

* Conclusion: The simulation demonstrates that user mobility significantly impacts load distribution in a WiFi network with multiple APs using a shared SSID. The throughput measured at each AP dynamically adjusts to reflect the number of users physically located in its vicinity, indicating effective re-association managed by the ns-3 WiFi STA MAC layer (aided by Active Probing). The total system throughput remains relatively constant, dictated by the number of active users and their transmission rates.
