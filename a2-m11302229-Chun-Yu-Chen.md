## ðŸ§­ Getting Started with My ns-3 Simulation Project

This simulation project demonstrates a dynamic WiFi environment using ns-3, where multiple STAs associate with two APs and switch connections based on mobility. To help you easily follow and replicate the process, Iâ€™ve organized all relevant resources into the following three parts:

1. **Installation Guide for ns-3:**  
   A step-by-step tutorial for setting up the ns-3 simulation environment on your local machine.

2. **Simulation Explanation:**  
   A detailed walkthrough of the simulation logic, milestones, output files, and analysisâ€”ideal for understanding how the code works and how the data is interpreted.

3. **Video Simulation:**  
   A visual demonstration of the simulation behavior, including STA movements, AP handovers, and performance impacts.
