## Task 1: 5-Minute Presentation

### 1.1. Mastering the art of 5 minute presentations.



### 1.2. Tips in 5 minutes - Presentations.

Based on this [tutorial](https://youtu.be/YVgS_opYacQ?feature=shared) by the University of North Carolina (UNC).

#### 1.2.1. Keep it simple
- You want people to pay attention to what you are saying, not the slides. **Your slides should be simple**.
- Do not always rely on templates, some are boring (overly used), and some are too complex.

#### 1.2.2. Never read from the slides
- The human brain is not very good at processing audio and text at the same time.
- Too much text on the screen can distract listeners from the speaker.
- Use small amount of text to summarize the key points, **as few words as possible**.
- Use simple and easy to read fonts and large sizes.
- One single point per slide.

#### 1.2.3. Use beautiful photos
- Images cause emotional reactions on the audience.
- Keep away from generic stock photos.
- Use images with permissions (avoid watermarks), some free resources are listed here:
    - [Creative Commons Search](https://search.creativecommons.org/).
    - [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
    - [Librestock](https://www.librestock.com/).
    - [The Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/).
- Look for big enough pictures (at least `1920 x 1280` pixels).
- When choosing pictures **consider the rule of thirds**, you want the focal point of the images to be near one of this four points in the slide.

*The four points indicated in the picture are considered visual hot spots, where the viewer's eye will most likely want to focus*.

#### 1.2.4. Keep data simple
- Use **simple data graphics** where information is readable to all the audience.
- If you create new graphics to make the data more presentable, always remember to be accurate and cite the sources.

#### 1.2.5. Repetition
- Repeat design elements across the slide deck.
- Choose **one font** and use it throughout the presentation.
- Choose a **simple color pallet of two to three colors** and use them consistently.
- Use **consistent layouts** across the slide deck.

## Task 2: How to read a paper

Review of ["How to read a paper" by S. Keshav](https://doi.org/10.1145/1273445.1273458).

### 2.1. Introduction
The author states that reading research papers is a critical skill for researchers, but it is often learned through trial and error, causing inefficiency and frustration. The paper presents a structured **three-pass approach** to reading papers efficiently. This helps researchers to grasp key ideas at different levels of depth and at the same time minimize the wasted effort.

### 2.2. The Three-Pass Approach
Instead of reading the paper sequentially from start to finish, the author proposes a three-pass method:

#### 2.2.1. First pass (Quick Scan, 5-10 minutes)
**Objective**: Gain a high-level understanding and decide whether further reading is necessary. Steps:
1. Read the *title*, *abstract* and *introduction* carefully.
2. Skim through *section* and *sub-section headings* without reading the content.
3. Read the *conclusions* to understand the key contributions.
4. Glance at the *references*, note if there are familiar ones.

At the end of this pass, the reader should answer five key questions:
- **Category**: type of paper.
- **Context**: relation to other work.
- **Correctness**: validity of the assumptions.
- **Contributions**: main results.
- **Clarity**: quality of writing.

#### 2.2.2. Second pass (Understanding key content, \~1 hour)
**Objective**: Understand the main arguments, key evidence and methodology. Steps:
1. Read the paper in more detail, but skip proofs and deep technical details.
2. Analyze *figures*, *tables* and *graphs*, check for correct labelling and statistical significance.
3. Mark *unread references* for further reading.

At the end of this pass, the reader should be able to summarize the key ideas of the paper to someone else.

#### 2.2.3. Third pass (Deep understanding, several hours)
**Objective**: Critically analyze the paper and reproduce its reasoning. Steps:
1. Reconstruct the paper's logic and assumptions.
2. Identify *hidden flaws*, *missing citations* or *unsubstantiated claims*.
3. Compare the paper's approach with alternative methods.
4. Take notes on *potential future research directions*.

At this stage, an experienced researcher should be able to recall the entire paper's structure and key takeaways from memory.

### 2.3. Applying the approach to literature surveys
The **three-pass method** is useful for conducting literature reviews efficiently:
1. Use **academic search engines** ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), [CiteSeer](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/)) to find recent papers.
2. **Perform a first pass** on several papers to get an overview.
3. **Identify key authors and citations**, then look at top conference proceedings to find high-quality work.
4. **Iterate through passes** until a well-rounded understanding is developed.

### 2.4. Conclusion
The structured three-pass approach improves efficiency and comprehension when reading research papers. It allows readers to choose the depth of their reading based on what they need, preventing them from making unnecessary efforts. This method is especially useful when reviewing papers, conducting literature surveys and writing research articles.

## Task 3: How to write a report

Summary on the [guide](https://www.openpolytechnic.ac.nz/current-students/study-tips-and-techniques/assignments/) provided by Open Polytechnic Kuratini Tuwhera. An overview of the approach to complete successfully a writing assginment:

### 3.1. Understanding the assignment task
Before beginning any assignment, it's crucial to completely understand the task at hand. This involves carefully reading the assignment question or prompt to identify the main topic and specific requirements. Rewriting the question in your own words can help to make more clear its meaning and ensuring you understand what is expected. Additionally, checking course materials and communications from instructors can provide further insights into the assignment's objectives.

### 3.2. Step-by-step guide to tackling assignments
The institution provides a structured approach with a five-step guide:
- **Step 1: Understand the assignment task**: Analyze the question to grasp what is being asked.
- **Step 2: Plan**: Develop a timeline and outline to organize your work.
- **Step 3: Conduct research**: Gather relevant information from trusted sources to support your arguments.
- **Step 4: Write**: Draft your assignment, make sure that is clear and coherent presenting your ideas.
- **Step 5: Review**: Proofread and edit your work to correct errors and refine the content.

This method is made to improve the quality and management of assignments.

### 3.3. Assignment types
You must understand the nature of the assignment, as different types require different approaches. Some common types are:
- **Essays**: Analytical or argumentative pieces on a specific topic.
- **Reports**: Structured documents presenting information and analysis on a particular subject.
- **Case studies**: In-depth examinations of specific situations or organizations to apply theoretical concepts.
- **Reflective journals**: Personal accounts that reflect on learning experiences and how they relate to course content.

Recognizing the assignment type guides the research process and determines the structure and style of the writing.

### 3.4. Writing skills
Good academic writing has coherence, clarity and proper structure. Some key skills to achieve that are:
- **Understanding the audience**: Tailor your writing to meet the expectations of your instructors and the academic community.
- **Develop a clear thesis statement**: Present the main argument or purpose of your assignment very clearly.
- **Logical organization**: Arrange your ideas systematically, using paragraphs and headings to enhance readability.
- **Critical analysis**: Engage with sources thoughtfully, evaluating their relevance and credibility.
- **Proper references**: Cite all sources accurately to acknowledge others' work and avoid plagiarism.

Improving this skills can help you create more persuasive and academically rigorous assignments.

### 3.5. Formatting and presenting assignments
Adhering to proper formatting guidelines enhances the professionalism and readability of your work. Important aspects include:
- **Following specific format requirements**: Use appropriate fonts, margins, and spacing as specified by your institution or instructor.
- **Including Essential Components**: Ensure your assignment contains all necessary sections, such as title page, abstract, introduction, body, conclusion, and references.
- **Consistent reference format**: Apply the required citation style (e.g., APA, MLA, BiBTeX) consistently throughout your assignment.
- **Proof-reading for errors**: Review your work to correct grammatical mistakes and ensure clarity.
