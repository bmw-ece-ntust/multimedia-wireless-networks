>Information Source:
>* [How to Read a Paper](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee384m/Handouts/HowtoReadPaper.pdf)

> [!TIP]
> A good researcher spends as much time reading as they do writing

Researchers should spend a lot of time to read papers to keep updated or doing literature review of a new field. Here is a "Three Pass" approach and how it is useful when doing a literature survey

### 2.1 Three Pass Approach
The idea is to read a paper in up to three passes, instead of reading from the start to the end of the paper. Each of the pass fulfil certain goals and complement the previous pass 

#### 2.1.1 The first pass
Quickly read the paper to get the main point of the paper. To do it:
* Read the abstract and introduction carefully
* Ignore everything, other than the headings
* Read the conclusions
* Take a quick look at the references, mark the paper that you have read

At the end of the first pass, you should be able to answer the five Cs:
* **Category**: type of the paper
* **Context**: bases of the paper
* **Correctness**: validity of the paper
* **Contributions**: main contribution of the paper
* **Clarity**: writing level of the paper

These informations can determine whether this paper is useful or not for us. On the contrary, you should consider these things when writing a paper so that most of the reader can understand our paper after first pass 


#### 2.1.2 The second pass
Read paper more carefully, but ignore details such as proofs:
* Look if the graphs, results, and conclusions are precise and relevant
* Write down unread references that will be useful to read  

After this pass, you should be able to understand the main content of the paper. If you still do not understand the paper, you can read the paper again later after studying some background knowledge or continue to the third pass

#### 2.1.3 The third pass
For the third pass, re-implement the paper to fully understand the paper, both the innovation and drawback of the paper. Think of ourself as the creator of the paper to elaborate every point in the paper. After this pass, you will be able to completely understand the paper. 

### 2.2 Doing a Literature Survey

You should read a lot of papers when doing a literature survey. Three tips to choose the right paper

#### 2.2.1 Use academic search engine 
Find recent papers by using keywords in the academic search engine such as Google Scholar. Do one pass and find related works on each paper. Try to find a recent survey paper. 

#### 2.2.2 Find shared citations
Look for the shared citations and repeated author names in the bibliography. These indicates the key papers and researchers in that area. Read the key papers and recent publications from those researchers.

#### 2.2.3 Find recent papers in top conferences 
Look for the website of these top conferences and quickly look their recent publications. Spot high quality works and do two passes for these papers.
