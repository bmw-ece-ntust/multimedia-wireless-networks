# Presentation

## How to Improve Presentation Skills: 5 Essential Tips

### 1. Keep It Simple

â€¢ Focus should be on the speaker, not the slides
â€¢ Avoid complex or overused templates
â€¢ Don't be afraid to start from scratch with simple designs

### 2. Never Read from Slides

â€¢ The brain struggles to process audio and text simultaneously
â€¢ Use minimal text to convey key points
â€¢ Include only one point per slide
â€¢ Use large fonts for better visibility from the back

### 3. Use Beautiful Photos

â€¢ Choose images that evoke emotional responses
â€¢ Avoid generic stock photos
â€¢ Use high-resolution images (minimum 1920x1280 pixels)
â€¢ Apply the rule of thirds for more engaging visuals

### 4. Simplify Data Presentation

â€¢ Ensure charts and graphs are clear and easy to understand
â€¢ Avoid over-complicated info graphics
â€¢ Select only the most crucial data points
â€¢ Maintain accuracy and credibility of information

### 5. Maintain Design Consistency

â€¢ Use the same font throughout
â€¢ Select 2-3 main colors and stick to them
â€¢ Keep layout consistent
â€¢ Create a cohesive and professional look

Tip: When designing presentations, remember that "less is more" - make it easier for your audience to understand and remember your key messages.

# Reading and Writing Papers

## How to Effectively Read Research Papers: The Three-Pass Method

Researchers spend hundreds of hours annually reading papers, yet this skill is rarely taught, leading to wasted time and inefficiency.

### Why Do We Need a Method for Reading Papers?

â€¢ Reasons for reading papers: reviews, staying current, literature surveys

â€¢ Particularly for graduate students, learning how to read papers efficiently is critical but often overlooked

â€¢ Lack of methodology leads to frustration and inefficiency

### Overview of the Three-Pass Method

Core concept: Read papers in three sequential passes, each providing deeper understanding

| **Pass** | **Description** | **Key Actions** | **Outcome** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **First Pass** | A quick scan to get an overview and decide whether further reading is needed | 1. Read the title, abstract, and introduction<br>2. Read section and subsection headings (ignore the details)<br>3. Read the conclusion<br>4. Glance over references and mark those already read | Able to answer the **5 Cs**:<br>1. **Category** â€“ What type of paper is this?<br>2. **Context** â€“ What other papers is it related to?<br>3. **Correctness** â€“ Are the assumptions valid?<br>4. **Contributions** â€“ What are the main contributions?<br>5. **Clarity** â€“ Is the paper well-written? |
| **Second Pass** | More careful reading to understand the content while skipping details like proofs | 1. Examine figures, diagrams, and graphs (check labels, error bars, statistical significance)<br>2. Take notes or write comments in the margins<br>3. Mark relevant unread references for further reading | Able to summarize the main idea and key evidence to others; suitable for papers of interest but outside your specialty |
| **Third Pass** | Deep understanding, especially useful for reviewers | 1. Try to re-implement the paperâ€™s assumptions and experiments<br>2. Challenge every assumption in the paper<br>3. Consider alternative ways to present the same ideas and note future research directions | Able to reconstruct the entire paper from memory and identify its strengths and weaknesses, including hidden assumptions, missing citations, and flaws in methodology |

- **First Pass: Quick Scan (5-10 minutes)**
    - Read the title, abstract, and introduction
    - Browse section and subsection headings
    - Read the conclusions
    - Glance over references
    
    After the first pass, you should be able to answer the five questions:
    
    - Category: What type of paper is this?
    - Context: What other papers is it related to?
    - Correctness: Are the assumptions valid?
    - Contributions: What are the main contributions?
    - Clarity: Is the paper well-written?
- **Second Pass: More Careful Reading (about 1 hour)**
    - Focus on **figures**, **diagrams**, and **illustrations**
    - Mark relevant unread references
- **Third Pass: Deep Understanding (1-5 hours)**
    - Attempt to "virtually re-implement" the paper
    - Challenge every assumption
    - Note down ideas for future work

### Literature Survey Application

Steps for conducting a literature survey using the three-pass method:

1. Use academic search engines to find 3-5 relevant papers
2. Look for shared citations and recurring authors
3. Check recent proceedings from top conferences

### Author's Experience and Conclusion

- The author has used this method for 15 years to read conference proceedings, write reviews, and conduct research
- The method prevents getting lost in details before gaining an overview
- Helps estimate time needed to review papers
- Allows adjustment of paper evaluation depth based on needs and available time

Personal Experience Sharing:

Presentation Skills: Understanding the principles of "Keep It Simple" and "Never Read from Slides" will allow me to create more effective presentations by focusing on key messages rather than overwhelming the audience with too much information, ensuring they can easily follow and remember the main points.

Research Paper Reading: Applying the Three-Pass Method will enable me to process papers more efficiently, gaining an overview before delving into details, and better identifying the most relevant literature for my research.

Teamwork: By establishing clear goals and fostering open communication, I can prevent issues related to unclear responsibilities and communication barriers in future team projects. Learning how to build trust and resolve conflicts constructively will help me create more efficient collaborative environments.

- Mastering these interpersonal skills will not only enhance my academic performance but also prepare me for future professional environments
