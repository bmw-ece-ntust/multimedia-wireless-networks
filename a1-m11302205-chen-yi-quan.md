# Presentation

## How to Improve Presentation Skills: 5 Essential Tips

### 1. Keep It Simple

• Focus should be on the speaker, not the slides
• Avoid complex or overused templates
• Don't be afraid to start from scratch with simple designs

### 2. Never Read from Slides

• The brain struggles to process audio and text simultaneously
• Use minimal text to convey key points
• Include only one point per slide
• Use large fonts for better visibility from the back

### 3. Use Beautiful Photos

• Choose images that evoke emotional responses
• Avoid generic stock photos
• Use high-resolution images (minimum 1920x1280 pixels)
• Apply the rule of thirds for more engaging visuals

### 4. Simplify Data Presentation

• Ensure charts and graphs are clear and easy to understand
• Avoid over-complicated info graphics
• Select only the most crucial data points
• Maintain accuracy and credibility of information

### 5. Maintain Design Consistency

• Use the same font throughout
• Select 2-3 main colors and stick to them
• Keep layout consistent
• Create a cohesive and professional look

Tip: When designing presentations, remember that "less is more" - make it easier for your audience to understand and remember your key messages.

# Reading and Writing Papers

## How to Effectively Read Research Papers: The Three-Pass Method

Researchers spend hundreds of hours annually reading papers, yet this skill is rarely taught, leading to wasted time and inefficiency.

### Why Do We Need a Method for Reading Papers?

• Reasons for reading papers: reviews, staying current, literature surveys

• Particularly for graduate students, learning how to read papers efficiently is critical but often overlooked

• Lack of methodology leads to frustration and inefficiency

### Overview of the Three-Pass Method

Core concept: Read papers in three sequential passes, each providing deeper understanding

- **First Pass: Quick Scan (5-10 minutes)**
    - Read the title, abstract, and introduction
    - Browse section and subsection headings
    - Read the conclusions
    - Glance over references
    
    After the first pass, you should be able to answer the five questions:
    
    - Category: What type of paper is this?
    - Context: What other papers is it related to?
    - Correctness: Are the assumptions valid?
    - Contributions: What are the main contributions?
    - Clarity: Is the paper well-written?
- **Second Pass: More Careful Reading (about 1 hour)**
    - Focus on **figures**, **diagrams**, and **illustrations**
    - Mark relevant unread references
- **Third Pass: Deep Understanding (1-5 hours)**
    - Attempt to "virtually re-implement" the paper
    - Challenge every assumption
    - Note down ideas for future work

### Literature Survey Application

Steps for conducting a literature survey using the three-pass method:

1. Use academic search engines to find 3-5 relevant papers
2. Look for shared citations and recurring authors
3. Check recent proceedings from top conferences

### Author's Experience and Conclusion

- The author has used this method for 15 years to read conference proceedings, write reviews, and conduct research
- The method prevents getting lost in details before gaining an overview
- Helps estimate time needed to review papers
- Allows adjustment of paper evaluation depth based on needs and available time
