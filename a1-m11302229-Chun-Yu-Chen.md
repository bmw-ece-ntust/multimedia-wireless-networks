## 0. Introduction
The purpose of this note is to learn the background knowledge of interpersonal skills and apply it in the following assignments and even in future research and work. 

To achieve this, I have reviewed the following articles: **5-Minute Research Presentation, How to Read a Paper, How to Write a Report, and 10 Tips for Better Teamwork**.
These articles provide essential guidance on effective communication, teamwork, and information processing, which are crucial for academic and professional success.

## 1. Five-Minute Research Presentation

> “If you get the first 5 minutes down, you are going to be golden for the rest of your presentation.” - Susi Varvayanis, Executive Director of Careers Beyond Academia

There are three parts of a presentation that can influence the outcome of the presentation.
* **You, the speaker**
* **Your presentation slides**
* **The audience**

### The Speaker
* **body language**:
  * Using gestures to emphasize key points. Remember to smile, show enthusiasm, and maintain eye contact with the audience to project confidence.
* **Voice modulation**
  * Avoiding speaking too quickly. Use pauses and vary your pace to emphasize key words.
* **Avoid jargon and acronyms**
  * If you must, use analogies or simpler terms to ensure clarity for a diverse audience. You can use the De-Jargonizer tool ([scienceandpublic.com](scienceandpublic.com)) to help identify jargon.
 

### Presentation Slides:
* **Keep it SIMPLE**
  * One key point per slide — avoid text overload
  * Use keywords and visuals to support understanding
  * Simple design is more effective than flashy animations
* **NEVER read from your slides**
  * Using a small amount of text can help people remember your main points
  * Explain in your own words — don’t just recite text
  * Maintain eye contact and engage with your audience
* **Use beautiful photos**
  * Choose high-quality images
  * Ensure visuals complement your message and enhance recall
  * make the focal point of photos is near one of these point — photos will look more dynamic and interesting
* **Keep data SIMPLE**
  * Present only the most essential data
  * Use clean, easy-to-read charts — avoid clutter
  * Visualize trends and comparisons effectively
* **Repetition**
  * Choose one font and use it throughout your presentation
  * Choose a simple color palette of 2-3 colors and use them consistently
  * Use consistently layout across your slide

### The Audience
The audience that you have dictates how you present your information.
* Evaluate your audience to understand their interests, commonalities, goals, and challenges.
* Ensure your visuals are engaging and intriguing to the audience.

### Making Your 5-Minute Pitch Memorable
* **Be passionate** about your work. This passion stems from a deep understanding of what inspires your research.
* Tell a **compelling story** with a clear flow and engaging visuals. This approach helps to reduce the need for extensive explanations and captures the audience's attention.
* Convey the **"why"** behind your work. Make sure the audience understands why your research matters, the implications of your findings, and how they can apply the information. You may also check the [Know Your Why | Michael Jr. – YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ytFB8TrkTo).


## 2. How to Read a Paper
### **First Pass: Bird's-Eye View (Overview)**
*   Goal: To get a quick overview of the paper and decide whether to proceed with further passes.
*   Steps:
    1.  Carefully read the title, abstract, and introduction.
    2.  Read the section and subsection headings, ignoring everything else.
    3.  Read the conclusions.
    4.  Glance over the references, mentally ticking off the ones you’ve already read.
*   At the end, you should be able to answer the five "C"s:
    1.  Category: What type of paper is this?
    2.  Context: Which other papers is it related to? Which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem?
    3.  Correctness: Do the assumptions appear to be valid?
    4.  Contributions: What are the paper’s main contributions?
    5.  Clarity: Is the paper well written?
*   You may choose not to read further if the paper doesn't interest you, you don't know enough about the area, or the authors make invalid assumptions.
*   **Key Point**: When writing a paper, most reviewers (and readers) will only do one quick pass, so coherent section and subsection titles and a concise and comprehensive abstract are crucial.

  
### **Second Pass: Grasping the Content  (Content Understanding)**
*   Goal: To read the paper more carefully, but ignore details such as proofs.
*   Steps:
    1.  Look carefully at the figures, diagrams, and other illustrations in the paper. Pay special attention to graphs. Are the axes properly labeled? Are results shown with error bars, so that conclusions are statistically significant?
    2.  Mark relevant unread references for further reading.
*   Jot down key points or make comments in the margins as you read.
*   After this pass, you should be able to summarize the main thrust of the paper, with supporting evidence, to someone else.
*   If you still don't understand the paper, you can (a) set it aside, (b) return to it later after reading background material, or (c) persevere and go on to the third pass.

### **Third Pass: In-Depth Understanding (Deep Analysis)**
*   Goal: To fully understand the paper, especially if you are a reviewer.
*   Method: Attempt to virtually re-implement the paper by making the same assumptions as the authors and re-creating the work. Compare this re-creation with the actual paper to identify the paper's innovations, hidden failings, and assumptions.
*   Steps:
    1.  Identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
    2.  Think about how you yourself would present a particular idea.
    3.  Jot down ideas for future work.
*   After this pass, you should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory and identify its strengths and weaknesses. In particular, you should be able to pinpoint implicit assumptions, missing citations to relevant work, and potential issues with experimental or analytical techniques.

### **Doing a Literature Survey**
*   **Search**: Use academic search engines (e.g., Google Scholar, CiteSeer) with relevant keywords to find 3-5 recent papers.
*   **Initial Review**: Skim the papers, focusing on the Related Work section.
*   **Identify Key Papers**: Look for frequently cited papers and repeated author names to find core research.
*   **Deep Exploration**: Download key papers, check the authors' recent publications, and browse top conference proceedings.
*   **Iterative Reading**: If multiple papers cite an important work you missed, obtain and read it, repeating the process as needed.


## 3. How to Write a Report
All reports have a similar structure, but some details may differ depending on the type of report. Always keep the reader in mind when writing a report. Be clear, concise, and accurate, and use a recognizable structure.

### **Report Structure**

| **Section**             | **Content** |
|------------------------|------------|
| **Title Page**        | Report title and author details |
| **Executive Summary (Optional)** | Concise findings, conclusions, and recommendations |
| **Contents (optional)** | list of the different sections and page numbers |
| **Terms of Reference** | Purpose, scope, and authorization details |
| **Procedure**         | Methods used for research or analysis |
| **Findings**         | Key data and observations |
| **Conclusions**      | Interpretation of findings (no new information) |
| **Recommendations**  | Suggested actions based on conclusions |
| **References**       | Properly formatted sources (APA style) |
| **Appendix (Optional)** | Supplementary materials |

### **Other considerations**
*   Different types of reports may have a slightly different structure.
*   Different structures may combine these sections or break them down using additional subheadings.
*   Be clear, concise, and structured.
*   If there are still questions, call the course leader for help.
