## 5-Minute Presentation
Purpose: 5 Tips for Creating Beautiful and Effective Presentation Slides

- Keep It Simple

   - Slides need to be simple — the audience should focus on you.
   - Templates are often dull (overused by many) or overly complicated.
   - Don’t be afraid to start from scratch.

- Never Read from Your Slides
   - The human brain struggles to process audio and text simultaneously.
   - Use brief text highlighting key points — choose a simple, easy-to-read font to keep text clear and large (consider the audience at the back).
   - Present only one main point per slide.

- Use Beautiful Photos
   - Select relevant photos that evoke emotion and strengthen your message.
   - Avoid cheesy, generic stock images.
   - Choose high-resolution images (at least 1920x1280 pixels).
   - Apply the rule of thirds for balanced composition.
   - Ensure you have permission to use the images.

- Keep Data Simple

   - Ensure charts and data are clear and directly support your point.
   - Avoid overly complex graphs.

- Repetition

   - Repeat design elements consistently across the entire presentation.
   - Select one font and use it throughout.
   - Opt for a simple color palette of 2-3 colors and apply it uniformly.
   - Maintain a consistent layout across your slide deck.

## Detailed Key Points from "How to Read a Paper" (Stanford Guide)

**Problem:**
Many students and researchers **struggle with reading academic papers efficiently**, often feeling overwhelmed by complex content and wasting time without gaining clear insights.

**Solution:**
  - Three-Pass Reading Method:
    - First Pass (5–10 min): Skim the title, abstract, introduction, section headings, conclusion, and references to identify the paper’s Category, Context, Correctness, Contributions, and Clarity (the “5 Cs”).
    - Second Pass (up to 1 hr): Focus on figures, key concepts, and methods. Highlight unclear parts and mark references to revisit.
    - Third Pass: Thoroughly re-implement the work, examine assumptions, and compare the study to related research.

**Conclusion:**
The Three-Pass Method, refined over 15 years of use in reading conference proceedings, writing reviews, and conducting research, offers a practical way to tackle academic papers. It prevents frustration by ensuring readers first build a strong overview before diving deep into complex ideas, allowing for flexible yet thorough paper evaluations based on time and need.

**Impact:**
- helps readers adjust reading depth as needed, improving both quick comprehension and deep analysis.
- sharpens critical thinking and streamlines literature reviews.
